There is no law or license that forbids the redistribution of this Package that I have created and am continuing to develop.  However, in fairness to me (Raven), I am requesting that if you want to include it in your Downloads that you do NOT actually include the ARCHIVE file, but instead, point it to my Download section.  The main reason being is that I'd really like to have as accurate as possible d/l count to measure whether or not to continue and then because the code is being tweaked and new add-ons will be coming at a fairly quick rate, I want people to always have the latest and greatest.  Thank you for your cooperation in this!
