Use these files at your OWN risk.  They are intended to be for
reference purposes, but can be used to first upgrade an existing 
PHP-Nuke installation to 7.6, making migrating to RavenNuke a 
bit easier.

But, again, use at your OWN risk AND ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS backup
your database PRIOR to running ANY upgrade / downgrade script so 
that you can very quickly get your database back to what it was
before you mucked with it.  LOL.

Refer to the HowToInstall Manual for more information on migrating
from a non-RavenNuke installation to a RavenNuke one.
